        <h3>John Badderman</h3>
        <p class="role">Company Villain</p>
        <p>Evil twin of John in more than just portrait pose. He gets results at the cost of burning out one intern a week. He doesn't have a cool native Kyrgyz cultural hat so he's worse than John.</p>

        <h3>Dan Sadderman</h3>
        <p class="role">Senior Engineering Manager</p>
        <p>Some will say he looks like an AI-generated version of Rico who was also not AI-generated. He says it's natural. Works in tech and is on the verge of a layoff at all times. Perpetually broken as a person.</p>
